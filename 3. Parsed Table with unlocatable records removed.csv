This is a view looking south from Park Place towards the small islands in the middle of the Thames at Bolney. Park Place, across the river from Henley-on-Thames is a large estate with a house originally dating from the early eighteenth century. Havell exhibited three views of or from Park Place at the Watercolour Society in 1827 of which this is almost certainly one. Another `View on the Thames from Park Place, Henleyâ€™, is recorded as in the collection of the Earl Cawdor and was the cover illustration in the 1982 Havell exhibition catalogue. The third, â€œWoodcutters at Park Place, Henleyâ€™ was sold at Christieâ€™s on 5th July 2011, lot 166 for Â£30,000.

TWW0000005653,Guy Peppiatt Fine Art,ENG,Dhows on the Nile,"Watercolour over pencil. This dates from M'ller's tour of Greece and Egypt in 1838-39. He left Bristol in September 1838 and spent six weeks in Athens before continuing to Alexandria in early November. M'ller was excited by the novelty of Egypt since '`a halo of mystery still lingered around this land of the ancient East'. M'ller was only twenty-six and, with his exceptionally fine eye for colour, light and shade, his imagination must have been fired by everything he saw (see Cyril Bunt, The Life and Work of William James M'ller of Bristol, 1948, p.37).
Â 
The crowded streets, exotic costumes and bazaars enthralled M'ller, especially in Cairo, and he subsequently sailed up the Nile as far as Luxor, Karnak and the Valley of the Kings. He returned to Bristol in the Spring of 1839. Two other Nile views by M'ller are in the British Museum (see Greenacre and Stoddard, W.J.

Of these forty, twenty-six were to be lithographed for a book `Sketches of the Age of Francis Iâ€™. MÃ¼ller left from Southampton with his pupil Edward Dighton in early June and visited various sites in Normandy reaching Paris on the 17th. After a month there and at Fontainebleau, he visited Orleans, Blois and the Loire valley before returning to England from St. Malo in September.

TWW0000005655,Guy Peppiatt Fine Art,ENG,"The Theatre of Xanthus, Lycia","Watercolour over pencil, with collector's mark lower right. This dates from the most important sketching tour of M'ller's career, in Lycia in modern day Turkey in the winter of 1843-44. He left England with his pupil Harry John Johnson (1826-1884) on 12th September 1843 and after stopping for supplies at Smyrna met up with the archaeologist Sir Charles Fellowes, who had organised the expedition, at the mouth of the river Xanthus. On 1st November they walked the six miles to Xanthus, the ancient capital of Lycia and they remained in the area for three months. M'ller worked constantly, despite the bad weather, and developed a looser more confident style and worked on a larger scale than he had before. 
Â 
He returned with `one or two hundred drawings' (N. Neal Solly, Memoir of the Life of William Muller, 1875, p.200, letter from M'ller to J. Satterfield, 12th February 1844) which were widely recognised as the finest achievement of his career. They were shown at a meeting of London's Graphic Society in January 1845 and then not until after his sudden death aged 33, only eighteenth months after his return. They were exhibited at the Bristol Institution, along with other works, before being sold in London. The Bristol Gazette described them thus: `The great characteristic of the sketches is their freedom and spirit ' a bold, comprehensive, almost daring ' and yet most natural ' grasping of the subject'.' (Bristol Gazette, 5th March 1846, p.3). For more on M'ller's Lycian trip, see Greenacre and Stoddart, W.J. M'ller, exhibition catalogue, 1991, p. 142-145.
Â 
This is a view of the remains of Xanthus.Â  In the foreground is a typical Lycian house tomb where the stone has been hewn to imitate wooden roof beams.Â  The Roman amphitheatre is behind and probably dates from the 2nd century AD.Â  It is relatively intact, with only the upper rows of the auditorium missing, having been used as construction material for later buildings.Â  On the far right is the top of the Pillar tomb, an unusual funeral monument in Lycia, as it is actually two tombs in one and it is likely to date from the 4th or 3rd centuries B.C.",1843,1843,William James Müller,1812-1845,Buildings & Architecture,"theatre,ruins","The Theatre Xanthus, Lycia"

Â 
Ludlow Castle is situated on a promontory between the Rivers Corve and Teme overlooking the town of Ludlow. Begun as a Norman fortress, and transformed into a Royal Palace during Medieval times, it is now owned by the Earls of Powis and is open to the public. The hill in the distance behind the castle is Titterstone Clee Hill, sometimes referred to incorrectly, as Clee Hill (which is a lower hill to the east).Â  Rising 533 m above sea level, the strange shaped summit is effectively man-made, the result of both hill fort construction during the Bronze and Iron Ages and, more recently, by years of mining for coal and quarrying for stone used in road-building.",1777,1777,Francis Towne,1740-1816,Buildings & Architecture,"landscapes,castles,hills,rivers","Ludlow Castle, Shropshire"

He arrived in Rome in October 1780 setting off for the Alps and home in August 1781. Towne spent about three weeks in Tivoli and the surrounding area in May. Tivoli had long held an attraction for British artists due to its combination of dramatic scenery and its link to the work of Claude and Dughet. 
Â 
Towne worked assiduously while he was there, producing over forty drawings and watercolours. `No.1â€™ is dated 1st May and the present drawing, dated 22nd May and numbered 40 is one of the last. Nos. 40 to 42, all views of Hadrianâ€™s Villa, and dated between 20th and 22nd May, were all at one time in the Worsley collection at Hovingham Hall. Adrian Bury (op. cit., p.95) describes them as catching `the haunting solitude and melancholy of this relic of the great and humane Emperor, Hadrian.â€™ Nine of Towneâ€™s Tivoli views are now in the British Museum and no. 39 from the group, a wash drawing of Neptuneâ€™s Grotto, Tivoli, is in the Tate Gallery.
Â 
Hadrianâ€™s Villa or Villa Adriana was constructed by the Emperor Hadrian in the early second century A.D. as a country retreat outside Rome.

When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he was designing a minaret.

With a pencil drawing of Conway Castle and bridge verso
27.6 by 37.6 cm, 10 ' by 14 ' inches
 
Provenance:
By descent to the artist's granddaughter until 1904;
With Walker Galleries, London, 1960
 
Exhibited:
London, Walker Galleries, Drawings by David Cox, 21 April to 11 May 1960, probably no.36, 'Harbour and Hillside', sold for 12 guineas
 
This wonderfully loose but controlled drawing is typical of Cox's work of the early 1850s when he is at his most confident and impressionistic. He concentrates on his depiction of the sky and especially the passing storm. It may be drawn on the same sketchbook sheet as a group of drawings of Rhyll Sands which date from 1854. Cox often used a rough Scotch paper at this period but these are ordinary wove paper which measures the same size as this sheet. One in the University of Liverpool Art Gallery is signed and dated 1854 (see Andrew Wilton and Annie Lyles, The Great Age of British Watercolours 1750-1850, 1993, no.77, pl.233), another is in the Victoria and Albert Museum and a third was sold at Christie's on 21st November 2001, lot 47.
 
Cox was a regular visitor to North Wales from the mid 1840s and the drawing of Conway Castle on the reverse suggests this could be a view on the North Welsh coast or possibly on the estuary of the river Conway.",1850,1850,David Cox the elder,1783-1859,Landscapes & Seascapes,"landscapes,seascapes,coasts",The Passing Storm

From there they travelled south to Chamonix and returned to Geneva via Montreux. 
Dated drawings by Towne reveal that they were still in Geneva on 11th September and had reached Vevey on the 20th. They headed north from Geneva and homewards on the 23rd.

The Great Exhibition of 1851, under the patronage of Prince Albert, took place at Hyde Park in a building that became known as the 'Crystal Palace'.Â  This revolutionary glass and iron building was designed by Joseph Paxton and Charles Fox.Â  With a committee overseeing its construction that included Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it went from a plan to the grand opening in just nine months. The exhibition was a showcase to display the wonders of industry and manufacturing from around the modern world.Â  It included over 13,000 exhibits and was extremely popular, attracting more than six million visitors - equivalent to a third of the population of Great Britain at the time. The profits from the exhibition helped fund the construction of the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums in South Kensington.
